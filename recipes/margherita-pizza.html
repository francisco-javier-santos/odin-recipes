        <p> 
            Pizza margherita, as the Italians call it, is a simple pizza hailing from Naples. 
            When done right, margherita pizza features a bubbly crust, crushed San Marzano tomato sauce,
            fresh mozzarella and basil, a drizzle of olive oil, and a sprinkle of salt. That is all.

        <h2>Ingredients (for 4 people)</h2>
        <h3>Homemade Pizza Dough</h3>
        <ul> 
            <li>2½ cups (300 g) unbleached all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon granulated sugar</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon active dry yeast or SAF instant yeast</li>
            <li>¾ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>7 ounces (105°F to 115°F) warm water</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>semolina and all-purpose flour for dusting the pizza peel</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Pizza Sauce</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup pureed or crushed canned San Marzano tomatoes (or canned Italian plum tomatoes)</li>
            <li>2-3 fresh garlic cloves grated with a microplane or pressed</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon extra virgin olive oil plus more for drizzling</li>
            <li>2-3 large pinches of kosher salt to taste</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Toppings</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2-3 tablespoons finely grated parmigiano-reggiano cheese plus more for serving</li>
            <li>7 ounces fresh mozzarella cheese (not packed in water) cut into ½-inch cubes</li>
            <li>5-6 large fresh basil leaves plus more for garnishing</li>
            <li>dried red pepper flakes optional</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Prepare Pizza Dough: In a medium bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, sugar, yeast
                and salt. Add the warm water and olive oil, and stir the mixture with a wooden spoon until
                the dough just begins to come together. It will seem shaggy and dry, but don't worry.
            </li>
            <li>
                Scrape the dough onto a well-floured counter top and knead the dough for three minutes. 
                It should quickly come together and begin to get sticky. Dust the dough with flour as needed
                (sometimes I will have to do this 2 to 3 times, depending on humidity levels) - it should be
                slightly tacky, but should not be sticking to your counter top. After about 3 minutes,
                the dough should be smooth, slightly elastic, and tacky. Lightly grease a large mixing
                bowl with olive oil, and place the dough into the bowl.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cover the bowl with a kitchen towel (or plastic wrap) and allow the dough to rise in a warm,
                dry area of your kitchen for 2 hours or until the dough has doubled in size.
            </li>
            <li>
                Preheat Oven and Pizza Steel or Stone: Place the pizza steel (or stone) on the second 
                to top rack of your oven, and preheat the oven and steel (or stone) to 550°F (285°C) for
                a minumum of 1 hour. If your oven does not go up to 550°F (285°C) or you are using a delicate
                pizza stone, I recommend heating it to a maximum of 500°F (260°C)
            </li>
            <li>
                As the oven is preheating, assemble the ingredients. In a small bowl, stir together the pureed 
                tomatoes, minced garlic, extra virgin olive oil, pepper, and salt. Set aside another small bowl
                with the cubed mozzarella cheese (pat the cheese with a paper towel to remove any excess moisture).
                Set aside the basil leaves and grated parmigiano-reggiano cheese for easy grabbing.
            </li>
            <li>
                Separate the dough into two equal-sized portions. It will deflate slightly, but that is OK.
                Place the dough on a large plate or floured counter top, cover gently with plastic wrap,
                and allow the dough to rest for 5 to 10 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Assemble the Pizza: Sprinkle the pizza peel with a tablespoon of semolina and dusting of
                all-purpose flour. Gently use both hands to stretch one ball of pizza dough. If the dough
                springs back or is too elastic, allow it to rest for an additional five minutes. 
                The edges of the dough can be slightly thicker, but make sure the center of the dough is
                thin. Gently transfer the dough onto the semolina and flour dusted pizza peel or baking sheet.
            </li>
            <li>
                Drizzle or brush the dough lightly with a teaspoon of olive oil. Using a large spoon, add
                roughly ½ cup of the tomato sauce onto the pizza dough, leaving a ½-inch or ¾-inch border
                on all sides. Use the back of the spoon to spread it evenly and thinly. Sprinkle a tablespoon 
                of parmigiano-reggiano cheese onto the pizza sauce. Add half of the cubed mozzarella,
                distributing it evenly over the entire pizza. Using your hands, tear a few large basil leaves,
                and sprinkle the basil over the pizza. Gently slide the pizza from the peel onto the
                heated baking stone. Bake for 7 to 8 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese 
                is bubbling and caramelized and the edges of the pizza are golden brown.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove the pizza carefully from the oven with the pizza peel, transfer to a wooden cutting
                board or foil, drizzle the top with olive oil, some grated parmigiano-reggiano cheese, and
                chiffonade of fresh basil. Slice and serve immediately and/or prepare the second pizza.
