        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p> A grilled cheese sandwich is a classic comfort food that features two slices of bread,
            typically buttered and toasted to a golden brown, with a generous layer of melted cheese
            in between. The most common cheese used is cheddar, but variations often include a mix of cheeses
            like gouda, mozzarella, or Swiss.
        </p>

            This sandwich is often enjoyed on its own or paired with a bowl of tomato soup, making 
            it a beloved choice for lunch or a quick snack.
